## kylemetscher.com

This is a port of [my website](https://github.com/kmetscher/kylemetscher-dot-com) to a stack of the [Laravel PHP framework](https://laravel.com/), the [React JavaScript library](https://reactjs.org/), and the [Inertia adapter library](https://inertiajs.com/).

## Changes

- Authentication via Laravel middleware

## Ideas

- Creating a permalink column in the post table to use for more readable and search-optimized URIs, or, using Laravel and React's URL tools to create permalinks while still using post ID primary keys
- Search bar?

## Security

- SQL injection vulnerabilities tested with [sqlmap.py](https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap)
- Using limited-privilege mySQL user
- Lightsail firewall - Does It Work?
